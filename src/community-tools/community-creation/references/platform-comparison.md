# Community Platform Comparison Guide

This document provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and selecting community platforms based on community needs, target audience, and strategic goals.

## Platform Selection Framework

Selecting the right platform is critical for community success. Without platforms matching community dynamics, communities have minimal chance to thrive.

### Selection Process

1. **Understand Target Audience** - Research where they currently gather and what tools they prefer
2. **Define Community Needs** - Identify required features and interaction patterns
3. **Evaluate Options** - Assess platforms against criteria
4. **Test with Users** - Validate with target audience members
5. **Select Platform** - Choose based on best fit, not familiarity or cost alone

### Evaluation Criteria

Use these criteria to evaluate platforms:

| Criteria | Questions to Ask |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Audience Fit** | Where does target audience already spend time? What platforms are they familiar with? |
| **Feature Match** | Does it support required interaction patterns? (async/sync, code, events, etc.) |
| **Moderation** | What moderation tools and controls are available? Can you handle spam, abuse, toxicity? |
| **Integration** | Does it integrate with existing tools and workflows? |
| **Accessibility** | Can all target members access and use it? Mobile support? Assistive technology? |
| **Scalability** | Will it support growth trajectory? What are scaling costs and limitations? |
| **Cost** | Total cost of ownership including licenses, hosting, maintenance, integrations? |
| **Customization** | Can you brand and customize to match community needs? |
| **Analytics** | What insights and metrics does it provide? |
| **Migration** | How easy is it to migrate data in/out? |
| **Vendor Health** | Is the platform actively maintained? What's the company stability? |

## Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to narrow platform options:

```
1. Do you need real-time chat or async discussions?
   ├─ Real-time → Discord, Slack, Matrix
   └─ Async → Discourse, GitHub Discussions, Forem

2. Is this for an open source project already on GitHub?
   ├─ Yes → GitHub Discussions (start here, expand later if needed)
   └─ No → Continue

3. Do you need courses/learning integrated?
   ├─ Yes → Circle, Mighty Networks
   └─ No → Continue

4. Is this a professional/B2B community?
   ├─ Yes → Slack, Circle, Discourse
   └─ No → Continue

5. What's your budget?
   ├─ $0 → Discord, GitHub Discussions, self-hosted Discourse/Forem
   ├─ <$100/month → Discourse (hosted), Circle (Basic)
   └─ $100+/month → Any platform

6. Do you need full control and data ownership?
   ├─ Yes → Self-hosted Discourse, Forem, Matrix
   └─ No → Any platform

7. Is your audience primarily developers?
   ├─ Yes → Discord, GitHub Discussions, Discourse
   └─ No → Circle, Mighty Networks, platform matching audience

8. Do you need voice/video features?
   ├─ Yes → Discord, Slack (paid), Circle
   └─ No → Any platform
```

## Hybrid Approaches

Many successful communities use multiple platforms strategically:

### Discord + GitHub Discussions

**Use Case:** Open source projects

**Split:**
- Discord: Real-time questions, social interaction, voice calls
- GitHub Discussions: Long-form technical discussions, RFCs, announcements

**Benefits:**
- Leverage strengths of each
- Developers comfortable with both
- Clear separation of use cases

**Example:** Many modern open source projects (Next.js, Remix, etc.)

### Discourse + Slack

**Use Case:** Product communities, professional groups

**Split:**
- Discourse: Public discussions, knowledge base, long-term content
- Slack: Private team collaboration, customer support, real-time

**Benefits:**
- Public discovery through Discourse
- Private support through Slack
- Searchable knowledge in Discourse

### Circle + Discord

**Use Case:** Paid communities, creator communities

**Split:**
- Circle: Courses, async discussions, member profiles, payments
- Discord: Real-time chat, social connection, voice events

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive learning experience
- Social connection via Discord
- Structured content via Circle

## Platform Migration

If you need to migrate platforms:

### Before Migration

1. **Survey members** about platform satisfaction and preferences
2. **Export all data** from current platform (if possible)
3. **Test new platform** with small group
4. **Plan transition** timeline and communication
5. **Prepare import** scripts or manual migration plan

### During Migration

1. **Announce early** and explain rationale
2. **Provide guides** for using new platform
3. **Run parallel** for transition period (2-4 weeks)
4. **Migrate content** (or key content)
5. **Support members** through transition

### After Migration

1. **Archive old platform** clearly
2. **Redirect** from old platform to new
3. **Gather feedback** on new experience
4. **Iterate** based on member input

## Self-Hosted vs. Hosted Decision

### Choose Self-Hosted If:

- You have technical resources for maintenance
- You need full control and data ownership
- You want to minimize long-term costs
- You have specific customization needs
- You're privacy/security sensitive

### Choose Hosted If:

- You want to focus on community, not infrastructure
- You lack technical resources
- You want guaranteed uptime and support
- You prefer predictable monthly costs
- You need fast setup

### Total Cost of Ownership Comparison

**Hosted Discourse: $100/month**
- Platform cost: $100
- Staff time: Minimal
- Infrastructure: $0
- Total: ~$100/month

**Self-Hosted Discourse: Variable**
- Platform cost: $0
- Infrastructure: $20-100/month
- Staff time: 5-10 hours/month setup + 2-4 hours/month maintenance
- Total: $20-100/month + staff time (often more expensive when including staff)

## Emerging Trends (2025)

### AI-Enhanced Platforms

Many platforms now include:
- Automated moderation assistance
- Content recommendations
- Sentiment analysis
- Chatbots for FAQs

**Consideration:** Ensure AI enhances rather than replaces human community management.

### Web3/Blockchain Communities

Platforms like Discord with token-gating, DAOs

**Consideration:** Only relevant if community is crypto-native; adds complexity otherwise.

### Federated Platforms

Matrix, Mastodon, ActivityPub-based

**Consideration:** Growing interest, but still niche; consider for privacy-focused communities.

## Recommendations by Community Type

### Developer/Open Source Community

**Recommended:**
1. **Primary:** GitHub Discussions (if on GitHub) or Discourse
2. **Supplement:** Discord for real-time
3. **Consider:** Matrix for privacy-focused

**Rationale:** Developers prefer integrated tools, async discussions, code support

### Learning Community

**Recommended:**
1. **Primary:** Circle or Mighty Networks
2. **Consider:** Self-hosted with Discourse + course platform

**Rationale:** Integrated courses, community, events in one place

### Product Community

**Recommended:**
1. **Primary:** Discourse or Forem
2. **Supplement:** Slack for power users
3. **Enterprise:** Custom solution (Tribe, Hivebuzz)

**Rationale:** Need support, feedback, feature requests, knowledge base

### Professional Network

**Recommended:**
1. **Primary:** Slack or Circle
2. **Consider:** LinkedIn Groups as discovery channel

**Rationale:** Professional interface, networking features, integrations

### Creator Community

**Recommended:**
1. **Primary:** Circle or Mighty Networks
2. **Supplement:** Discord for social

**Rationale:** Payments, courses, member matching, professional feel

## Key Takeaways

1. **Audience First:** Select platform based on where target audience is comfortable, not what you prefer
2. **Feature Match:** Ensure platform supports required interaction patterns
3. **Start Simple:** Begin with one platform; add others only when clear need emerges
4. **Test First:** Validate with target users before committing
5. **Plan Migration:** Understand exit strategy before entering
6. **Budget Realistically:** Include staff time in total cost calculations
7. **Hybrid Works:** Multiple platforms can be strategic if clear purpose for each
