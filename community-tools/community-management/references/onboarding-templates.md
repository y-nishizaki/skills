## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports:
- **Check the issue tracker** - Someone may have already reported it
- **Verify the bug** - Can you reproduce it consistently?
- **Check documentation** - Is this intended behavior?

**Good bug reports include**:
- **Clear title** - Summarize the problem
- **Steps to reproduce** - Detailed reproduction steps
- **Expected vs. actual behavior** - What should happen vs. what does happen
- **Environment** - OS, version, configuration
- **Screenshots/logs** - Visual aids if applicable

Use our [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Include:
- **Use case** - What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution** - How should it work?
- **Alternatives** - Other approaches considered
- **Impact** - Who benefits from this feature?

Use our [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

### Contributing Code

#### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Avoid duplicate work
2. **Discuss significant changes** - Open an issue first for major features
3. **Review the roadmap** - Ensure alignment with project direction

#### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. **Create a branch** - Use descriptive names: `fix/issue-123` or `feature/new-capability`
3. **Set up development environment** - See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)
4. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow [style guide](#style-guide)

6. **Commit your changes** - Use [clear commit messages](#commit-messages)
7. **Push to your fork**
8. **Open a Pull Request** - Use our [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

#### Style Guide

- **Code formatting**: Run `[formatter command]` before committing
- **Linting**: Pass all linter checks (`[linter command]`)
- **Naming conventions**: [Describe conventions]
- **Comments**: Explain *why*, not *what*
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with code changes

#### Commit Messages

Follow this format:

```

```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples**:
```

Implements JWT-based authentication for API access.
Includes token refresh mechanism.

Closes #456
```

#### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Update tests for changed behavior
- Ensure all tests pass: `[test command]`
- Aim for [coverage target]% code coverage

3. **Request review** - Tag relevant maintainers
4. **Address feedback** - Respond to review comments
5. **Squash commits** (if requested) - Clean up history before merge
